# LT_PhotoAlbum

Photo Album Interview Question

Description:

I decided to develop this console application inside of Visual Studio using C#. I went with Json.NET by newtonsoft in order to deserialize the JSON data
into a C# array after the http client sends the get request. I then worked with the now parsed C# array objects and created the application by manipulating
the data. I attempted to write a unit test that would make sure to test the deserialzation was being done correctly and that the JSON was coming back 
as it should, however I am unsure on how to address the error in the unit test for the time being. Asides from this the console application looks to be
working properly.

How to run:

1.) Clone repository or download the zip folder containing the code, and open the LT_photoAlbum.sln file/project in Visual Studio.

2.) Program.cs and Post.cs is the console application code, and there is a separate project referenced with the attempted unit test

3.) To run the project, hit the play button in the upper left corner of Visual Studio. The output will be displayed in the terminal/console.
