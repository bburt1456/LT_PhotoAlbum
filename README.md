Photo Album Interview Question

Description:

I decided to develop this console application inside of Visual Studio using C#. I went with Json.NET by newtonsoft in order to deserialize the JSON data
into a C# array after the http client sends the get request. I then worked with the now parsed C# array objects and created the application by manipulating
the data. I attempted to write a unit test that would make sure to test the deserialzation was being done correctly and that the JSON was coming back 
as it should, however I am unsure on how to address the error in the unit test for the time being. Asides from this the console application looks to be
working properly.

How to run:

1.) Clone repository, and open the solution/project in Visual Studio.

2.) Program.cs and Post.cs is the console application code, and there is a separate project referenced with the attempted unit test

3.) To run the project, hit the play button in the upper left corner of Visual Studio.
